          Hello fellow programmer (or non-programmer <span role="img" aria-label="smiley face">ðŸ˜„</span> - we all need to generate a GUID from time to time - no judging here)!
          I am hoping to make this site the best place for frequently used tools like encoding/decoding, hashing things, generating UUIDs, etc.
          This site is entirely client-side so that once the site is loaded, everything will happen on your browser and should be very fast.
        </p>
